# RAG---Zakey

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines information retrieval with answer generation to produce accurate and fact-based responses. The system uses the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from Sentence Transformers to convert text into semantic embeddings, allowing it to search the knowledge base by meaning rather than by keywords. Once the most relevant sentence is retrieved, a question-answering model (distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad) is used to extract the exact answer from the retrieved context. During the project, the system was tested, improved, and expanded. A new knowledge entry about Pelé was added: "Pelé was a Brazilian footballer widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. He won three FIFA World Cups in 1958, 1962, and 1970." The knowledge embeddings were re-generated, and the system successfully answered the test question: "How many FIFA World Cups did Pelé win?" with the answer "three". The project demonstrates how RAG systems reduce hallucination and ensure reliable AI outputs. It can be extended by adding more knowledge sentences and re-encoding them before testing with new queries
